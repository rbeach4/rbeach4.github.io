# Building a Blog with MDX and Vite

In this post, I'll walk through the technical implementation of this blog, covering the architecture decisions and key implementation details.

## Project Setup

The foundation is a React + Vite + TypeScript application. Here's what we need to add for MDX support:

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
npm install -D @mdx-js/mdx @mdx-js/react @mdx-js/rollup
```

## Vite Configuration

The key to making MDX work with Vite is configuring the Rollup plugin:

```typescript
import mdx from '@mdx-js/rollup'
import remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    mdx({
      remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm],
      providerImportSource: '@mdx-js/react',
    }),
    react(),
  ],
})
```

**Important:** The MDX plugin must come before the React plugin!

## Routing Architecture

This blog uses a hybrid approach:

- `/` - Single-page portfolio (existing functionality)
- `/blog` - Blog post listing
- `/blog/:slug` - Individual blog posts
- `*` - 404 page

### Why This Approach?

1. **SEO-Friendly** - Each post has its own URL
2. **Shareable** - Users can bookmark individual posts
3. **Clean Separation** - Portfolio and blog are distinct
4. **Scalable** - Easy to add more posts

## Content Management

Blog posts are stored as `.mdx` files in `src/posts/` with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Post Title"
date: "2026-01-16"
excerpt: "Short description"
tags: ["react", "vite"]
slug: "post-slug"
---
```

### Loading Posts Dynamically

Vite's glob import feature makes it easy to load all posts:

```typescript
export async function getAllPosts() {
  const modules = import.meta.glob('../posts/*.mdx',
    { eager: true }
  )
  // Process and return posts...
}
```

## Styling MDX Content

MDX allows you to customize how each HTML element renders:

```typescript
const components = {
  h1: (props) => <h1 className="mdx-h1" {...props} />,
  code: (props) => <code className="mdx-code" {...props} />,
  // ... more components
}

<MDXProvider components={components}>
  <PostContent />
</MDXProvider>
```

This ensures consistent styling across all blog posts while maintaining the dark theme.

## GitHub Pages Deployment

One challenge with client-side routing on GitHub Pages is handling direct navigation to routes. The solution:

1. Create a `404.html` that redirects to `index.html`
2. Preserve the path in sessionStorage
3. Restore the route on page load

## Performance Considerations

- **Code Splitting** - Each MDX post is lazy-loaded
- **Static Imports** - Frontmatter is loaded eagerly for fast listing
- **Optimized Builds** - Vite handles chunking and optimization

## What's Next?

Future enhancements could include:

- Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Reading time estimates
- Table of contents generation
- Related posts based on tags
- Search functionality

## Conclusion

MDX + Vite provides an excellent foundation for a developer blog. The combination of static content with dynamic components offers flexibility while maintaining simplicity.
